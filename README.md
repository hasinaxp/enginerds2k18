# Enginerds 2k18

this is the final source code of out annual techfest 2018, Government College Of Engineering and Leather Technology, Kolkata. this project mainly uses gsap tweenmax lib for animation purpose.

this project uses states to represent different views of the site.
most of the text contents are loaded dynamically by fetch to help optimization.


# disclaimer
 my goal was to build a dynamic single page site that could attract teenages and college students so the animations are a bitsaturated. I would like to give a special thanks to all hose people who attended our techfest (ENGINERDS).
